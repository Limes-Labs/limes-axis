# Limes Axis Public Plan

Last updated: 2026-07-04

## Summary

Limes Axis is the sovereign AI control plane for European operations.

It starts as an open-source core that can run locally or in controlled
infrastructure, then expands into managed cloud, dedicated enterprise and
on-prem deployment paths.

Axis is designed to integrate first and replace gradually: existing systems stay
in place while Axis becomes the governed layer where data, workflows, people,
permissions and AI agents operate together.

## Product Principles

- Sovereignty must be practical: the open core must not require managed services.
- AI agents must be governed, permissioned, observable and auditable.
- Human approval remains central for risky actions.
- Operational ontology is the core context layer.
- Workflow execution must be durable and inspectable.
- Public open-source core and commercial operations should reinforce each other.
- The initial repository is unified, but future extraction into modules/repos is
  expected when parts grow large enough.

## Public Architecture Direction

Axis will use:

- Python + TypeScript as the two-language rule.
- Next.js + React for the governance console.
- FastAPI for the core API.
- REST/OpenAPI for public and internal contracts.
- Postgres for operational and transactional data.
- TypeDB for operational ontology and relationship-aware reasoning.
- Temporal OSS as the initial self-hosted workflow runtime behind an adapter.
- OIDC-first identity, with self-hosted Keycloak support.
- RBAC, ABAC and relationship-aware permissions.
- Append-only audit ledger.
- Provider-agnostic model routing with no external data egress by default.
- Docker Compose for local development and Kubernetes/Helm for production paths.

The browser governance console no longer ships local overview fallback records.
Visible records must come from Axis API responses or persisted tenant state. The
manufacturing overview endpoint now reads a tenant-scoped
`demo_reference_records` bootstrap row and returns explicit API errors when the
record is missing or invalid. The connector registry endpoint follows the same
pattern with `surface=connectors` and
`reference_id=manufacturing-connector-registry`. The agent registry endpoint
also reads from `surface=agents` and
`reference_id=manufacturing-agent-registry`; the API module no longer defines
an agent registry runtime seed factory. The action registry endpoint reads from
`surface=actions` and `reference_id=manufacturing-action-registry`; action run
requests validate their action definitions against that same persisted record
instead of a runtime seed factory and derive ontology resource relationship
scopes from `surface=ontology/reference_id=manufacturing-ontology` before
writing action/audit state.
The workflow console reference endpoint reads from `surface=workflows` and
`reference_id=manufacturing-workflow-console`, while
`/demo/manufacturing/workflows/runs` continues to query operational workflow run
state and tenant-scoped timeline events. The API module no longer defines a
workflow console runtime seed factory; tests validate the Alembic bootstrap
payload directly. The approval inbox endpoint reads from
`surface=approvals` and `reference_id=manufacturing-approval-inbox`; approval
decision submissions validate approval ids, workflow ids and required
permissions against that same persisted record before writing approval, audit
or workflow-signal evidence. The API module no longer defines an approval
inbox runtime seed factory; tests validate the Alembic bootstrap payload
directly. The audit explorer reference endpoint reads from
`surface=audit` and `reference_id=manufacturing-audit-explorer`; the separate
audit events and export endpoints continue to query persisted `audit_events`.
The API module no longer defines an audit explorer runtime seed factory; tests
validate the Alembic bootstrap payload directly.
The model routing reference endpoint reads from `surface=model-routing` and
`reference_id=manufacturing-model-routing`; live provider routing, usage
metering and billing adapters remain separate Platform work. The API module no
longer defines a model routing runtime seed factory; tests validate the Alembic
bootstrap payload directly.
The ontology graph and entity detail endpoints read from `surface=ontology` and
`reference_id=manufacturing-ontology`; the query runtime now applies metadata
and relationship-scope filtering to that persisted graph instead of loading a
route-owned seed. The API module no longer defines ontology graph/detail
runtime seed factories; tests validate the Alembic bootstrap payload directly.
The API test suite also includes a consolidated reference-surface guard that
fails if a listed reference endpoint loses its Alembic bootstrap record or if
the API reintroduces a `get_manufacturing_*` runtime reference factory.
Approval decisions now transition linked action-run evidence or create an
idempotent approval gate record in Postgres. Action runs can also record
governed dry-run/execution outcomes with audit evidence and workflow completion
timeline updates. The full manufacturing reference demo remains open until
broader live workflow execution and replay paths are backed by real persistence.
The local demo environment now has a repeatable runbook and automated readiness
check in `docs/demo-readiness.md` and
`services/api/scripts/check_demo_environment.py`. The check validates the demo
Makefile targets, local self-hosted runtime services, critical OpenAPI routes,
documentation links, optional live API/web endpoints, browser no-store CORS for
dev and production-build demo origins, the persisted manufacturing operations
snapshot contract, the demo readiness report contract and the Axis console
brand shell. It is a demo readiness gate, not a production enterprise readiness
claim.
The Kubernetes deployment baseline now lives in `infra/helm/limes-axis`, with
`docs/deployment.md` and `services/api/scripts/check_deployment_package.py`
guarding chart files, externalized runtime configuration, rollout controls,
public-safe docs, the `deployment-check` Make target, cert-manager
ingress-shim annotations, Helm smoke tests and a rollout rehearsal script for
upgrade, readiness, backup capture, isolated Postgres restore and rollback
mechanics plus TypeDB export/import into an isolated target, bounded
object-storage recovery into an isolated bucket, Temporal namespace/history
evidence capture from an isolated recovery pod and active/staged Secret
rotation comparison from an isolated non-root pod. It is an initial production
deployment guide baseline, not a claim that high availability, image release
automation, DNS ownership, certificate renewal operations, full external
secret-manager rotation, access-review operations, workload restart validation,
full Temporal persistence restore, full-bucket object-store disaster recovery,
KMS-backed signing or customer bucket operations are complete.
The API and web container image baseline now includes `services/api/Dockerfile`,
`apps/web/Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `make container-check`,
`make container-build-api` and `make container-build-web`. These images are
locally buildable and align with the Helm defaults. The web runtime stage
removes the bundled `npm`/`npx` package-manager surface from the final image
because production starts through the app-local Next.js binary. The container
baseline is still not image provenance, signing or registry release automation.
The container release supply-chain baseline now includes
`.github/workflows/container-release.yml`, `make container-release-check` and
`services/api/scripts/check_container_release.py`. The workflow builds the API
and web images for GHCR through a build-only `build-images` job for tag and
default manual runs. Publish runs are separate: `validate-promotion-evidence`
requires a release approval issue, a rollback plan issue, a rollback drill id
and `rollback_plan_acknowledged=true`, then verifies the issue URLs with
`gh issue view`; `publish-images` depends on that evidence gate and declares
the `axis-container-release` GitHub Environment so repository administrators
can attach required reviewer settings to publication without blocking build-only
checks. Published digests use BuildKit SBOM and provenance attestations and
GitHub OIDC keyless signing. This is still not a production deployment
certification: GitHub environment reviewer settings, registry retention,
recurring rollback drill operations and long-term SBOM archival remain
Enterprise hardening work.
The container vulnerability scanning baseline now includes
`.github/workflows/container-security.yml`, `make container-security-check`,
`make container-scan-local` and
`services/api/scripts/check_container_security_scan.py`. The workflow builds
the API and web images from their Dockerfiles and blocks fixed `CRITICAL`
OS/library vulnerabilities using Trivy `v0.71.2`, with the Trivy action pinned
to the v0.36.0 commit SHA. The local scan writes JSON evidence under
`.axis/trivy-reports/`. This is a real scan gate for the current release path,
not a production vulnerability management program: `HIGH` escalation, exception
expiry, SARIF publication, registry retention and promotion-review policy remain
Enterprise hardening work.
The vulnerability management baseline now adds HIGH/CRITICAL SARIF publication
to GitHub code scanning through the same container security workflow, with
`github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` pinned to
`8aad20d150bbac5944a9f9d289da16a4b0d87c1e`. It also adds
`.github/vulnerability-exceptions.json`, `make vulnerability-management-check`
and `services/api/scripts/check_vulnerability_management.py`. Exceptions must
have owner roles, review tickets, promotion review and expiry; HIGH exceptions
may last at most 45 days, and CRITICAL exceptions may last at most 14 days.
There are no approved vulnerability exceptions in the current baseline. This is
still not an enterprise vulnerability management operating model: registry
retention, recurring release rollback drills, customer-specific gates and
operational review cadence remain hardening work.

The manufacturing operations dataset now has a dedicated persisted surface:
`GET /demo/manufacturing/operations` reads tenant-scoped
`manufacturing_operation_records` rows and supports server-side filters for
domain, status, record type and source system. The first bootstrap covers
production orders, material lots, supplier posture, quality batch evidence,
machine status and maintenance windows as redacted business metadata from
ERP/MES/QMS/CMMS/Supplier Portal boundaries. Live source-system queries and
secret retrieval remain behind connector runtime, credential lease and egress
policy boundaries.
`GET /demo/manufacturing/operations/snapshot` composes the persisted operation
records with generated daily briefs, risk scenarios, workflow runs, approval
records and recent audit events. It is read-only, stores no new rows and does
not generate artifacts, signal workflows, run connectors or query source
systems. The governance overview now consumes this snapshot alongside the
overview reference endpoint, so the first screen shows persisted domain rollups,
generated artifacts, active workflows, pending approvals and recent audit
evidence instead of only the older overview reference payload.
`GET /demo/manufacturing/demo-readiness` derives SME feedback and enterprise
evaluation walkthrough readiness from the persisted operations snapshot. It
returns tracks, evidence checks, production-readiness limitations, next actions
and the `derived_from_persisted_demo_evidence` boundary. The governance
overview consumes this endpoint in the browser, with no local readiness
fallback records.
The Operations overview can also call the live artifact endpoints from the
browser: `POST /demo/manufacturing/operations/daily-brief`,
`POST /demo/manufacturing/operations/risk-scenarios/quality`,
`POST /demo/manufacturing/operations/risk-scenarios/maintenance` and
`POST /demo/manufacturing/operations/risk-scenarios/supplier-delay`.
The console derives `requested_by`, `actor_scopes` and `tenant_id` only from the
API-validated identity session, blocks submission when required scopes are
missing and refreshes the persisted operations snapshot after success. The
guided local Keycloak/browser SSO setup now imports a local-only Keycloak
realm, provides an API SSO profile and exposes a console **Sign in with SSO**
path so design partners can run the mutation walkthrough without pasting bearer
tokens.
`GET /demo/manufacturing/notifications` derives topbar platform notifications
from the same persisted operations snapshot, including operation-domain
attention, pending approval gates, blocked workflow signals and recent audit
evidence. The browser no longer synthesizes notifications from the overview
reference payload. `POST
/demo/manufacturing/notifications/{notification_id}/acknowledgement` persists
read/ack state per tenant actor, enforces `notifications:acknowledge`, writes
`platform.notification.acknowledged` audit evidence and refreshes the
notification read model without browser-local fallback data.
The `/settings` console reads `/ready`, `/identity/oidc/readiness`,
`/identity/session`, `/deployment/readiness` and `/support/diagnostics`
directly from the API. It shows enterprise SSO posture, deployment blockers,
support diagnostics, redaction policy and runtime dependencies, and falls back
only to an API-required empty state when those endpoints are unavailable.
`POST /demo/manufacturing/operations/daily-brief` creates a persisted daily
plant brief from those operation records, enforces `briefs:generate`,
`audit:read` and `workflows:read`, writes
`manufacturing.daily_brief.generated` audit evidence and returns idempotent
replays for duplicate requests. The brief generator is deterministic and does
not invoke a placeholder model provider or mutate production systems.
`POST /demo/manufacturing/operations/risk-scenarios/quality` creates a
persisted quality risk scenario from `domain=Quality` operation records,
enforces `quality:read`, `workflows:read` and `audit:read`, writes
`manufacturing.risk_scenario.generated` audit evidence and returns idempotent
replays for duplicate requests. The scenario generator does not mutate QMS/MES,
approve a hold or call a model provider.
`POST /demo/manufacturing/operations/risk-scenarios/maintenance` creates a
persisted maintenance risk scenario from `domain=Maintenance` operation records,
enforces `maintenance:read`, `workflows:read` and `audit:read`, writes
`manufacturing.risk_scenario.generated` audit evidence and returns idempotent
replays for duplicate requests. The scenario generator does not mutate CMMS/MES
work orders, approve dispatch changes or call a model provider.
`POST /demo/manufacturing/operations/risk-scenarios/supplier-delay` creates a
persisted supplier delay scenario from `domain=Supply` operation records,
enforces `supply:read`, `workflows:read` and `audit:read`, writes
`manufacturing.risk_scenario.generated` audit evidence and returns idempotent
replays for duplicate requests. The scenario generator does not mutate Supplier
Portal or ERP records, approve expedite actions or call a model provider.

The governance console includes a local OIDC session bridge for demo and
developer workflows. A user can attach a bearer token in the console toolbar;
the console stores it in browser session storage and sends it as
`Authorization: Bearer ...` to protected API calls. `GET /identity/session`
validates the attached token through the API, returns the API-owned actor,
tenant, scopes, expiry and SSO posture for the account panel, and never returns
bearer token material. The API also exposes `GET /identity/oidc/authorize` and
`GET /identity/oidc/callback` for a PKCE authorization-code flow that exchanges
the code server-side, requires `openid` scope readiness, validates the returned
`id_token` signature, issuer, expiry, client audience, authorized party when
present, login nonce and access-token subject binding, then sets an HTTP-only
signed Axis session cookie. The cookie carries a high-entropy Axis
`session_id`; the API stores only a keyed hash of that session id plus actor,
tenant, scopes and expiry in `oidc_browser_sessions`, so provider token
material is not persisted in the session store. `GET /identity/oidc/logout`
clears the Axis cookie, revokes the persisted session, writes
`identity.oidc_session.revoked` audit evidence and redirects the browser to the
configured OIDC end-session endpoint without persisting or forwarding provider
token material. `POST /identity/session/logout` performs local API session
revocation without the federated provider redirect.
`GET /identity/oidc/onboarding` returns a public-safe IdP onboarding report with
the exact redirect URIs, post-logout redirect URIs, endpoint URLs, claim
mappings, scopes, recommended IdP controls and open action items an identity
administrator needs to configure Axis. It does not return confidential client
material, cookie-signing material, provider tokens or raw JWKS material.
Without a token or session cookie, `/identity/session` reports explicit
public-evaluation state when OIDC auth is optional; when OIDC auth is required,
it returns `401` until a valid bearer token or non-revoked API session cookie is
attached.

Browser sessions carry a production lifecycle. When the provider issues a
refresh token and the refresh-credential encryption key is configured, the API
stores it only as AES-GCM ciphertext on the session row under an HKDF-derived
key (minimum key length enforced at startup), and
`POST /identity/session/refresh` rotates the Axis session id, cookie and stored
refresh credential server-side inside an absolute lifetime cap. The rotation is
guarded by an atomic `active`->`refreshing` claim and the IdP token exchange
runs outside the open database transaction, so two concurrent refreshes with
the same cookie cannot both mint a child session; provider rejection revokes
the session and forces a fresh login. Sessions enforce idle and absolute
timeouts plus a per-actor concurrent-session cap, and every lifecycle
transition (login, failed code exchange, refresh, failed refresh, revocation,
logout) appends audit evidence that references sessions only by keyed hash.
`GET /identity/sessions` lists the calling actor's sessions as opaque
references and `POST /identity/sessions/{session_ref}/revoke` revokes them;
tenant-wide listing and revocation require the `identity:sessions:admin` scope
and lookups stay tenant-isolated. CSRF is enforced centrally for every
cookie-authenticated state-changing request across the API through a
double-submit `X-Axis-Csrf-Token` header matched against the HMAC-derived CSRF
cookie issued at login; bearer-token and safe-method requests are exempt, and
Secure profiles use `__Host-`-prefixed session and CSRF cookies.

The web console adopts this lifecycle in its shared API request layer rather
than per page. Cookie-session mutations read the JavaScript-readable CSRF
cookie (including the `__Host-` variant) and attach the `X-Axis-Csrf-Token`
header; bearer-bridge requests stay exempt. A cookie-session `401` triggers a
single deduplicated `POST /identity/session/refresh` followed by exactly one
retry with the rotated CSRF cookie; refresh failure announces the signed-out
state and re-runs the live queries so `/identity/session` reports the public
state, and anonymous `401`s never trigger refresh attempts. The
`/settings/sessions` view lists the actor's persisted browser sessions with
lifecycle metadata, revokes non-current sessions by opaque reference, exposes
the tenant-wide listing toggle only when the identity read model carries
`identity:sessions:admin`, and treats revoking the current session as a
federated logout navigation.
Customer-specific production SSO operations runbooks remain Enterprise
onboarding work.

The ontology explorer and entity detail pages are currently read-only and API
required; the browser no longer carries a local graph fallback. Graph reads now
pass through the Axis ontology query runtime, expose query metadata and can
filter relationships by OIDC-derived relationship scopes when a bearer token is
present or OIDC auth is required by configuration. The TypeDB read boundary is
optional and separated from graph mutations. TypeDB read answers are normalized
at the client boundary, and structured ontology document rows can be mapped into
the public graph response before relationship-scope filtering. Ontology
relationships now include ownership, source adapter, confidence, evidence,
validity and verification metadata. Broader TypeDB query coverage, live graph
promotion coverage and broader graph authorization remain Platform work.

The workflow console is currently read-only and API required, with a persisted
workflow run endpoint available when Postgres records exist. The browser no
longer carries workflow fallback records. Approval decisions now signal the
workflow runtime adapter when available. Deterministic replay, workflow history
retention and workflow mutation controls remain Platform work.

The approval queue is still read-only for listing, but the listing now comes
from a persisted tenant-scoped reference row rather than route-owned seed data.
A demo decision endpoint now persists approval decisions and appends audit
events, and the web console submits reviewer decisions to it without creating a
standalone local decision preview when persistence fails. The decision endpoint
enforces the required demo approval scope before
persistence and signals the workflow runtime adapter. When a bearer token is
present, or when OIDC auth is required by configuration, the endpoint validates
the token against configurable OIDC/JWKS settings and derives tenant, actor and
scopes from token claims before persistence. Broader relationship-aware
permission enforcement remains Platform work.

The audit explorer is API required, its reference view is now loaded from a
persisted tenant-scoped bootstrap row, and it can query persisted
`audit_events` through the demo API when records exist. The browser no longer
carries audit fallback records. The demo API can also return a redacted JSON
export bundle with manifest checksum, applied filters, retention-window
enforcement, hash-chain integrity proof and a ledger signature proof. When
`AXIS_AUDIT_LEDGER_SIGNING_SECRET` is configured, the API signs the export
manifest plus hash-chain proof with a self-hosted HMAC-SHA256 signer; when it
is not configured, the bundle reports an explicit `unsigned` proof instead of
pretending a managed KMS signature exists.
`POST /demo/manufacturing/audit/retention/delete` adds a permission-gated
physical retention deletion execution path for tenant-scoped audit rows. It
supports dry-run, blocks deletion under active persisted legal holds or an
explicit legal-hold request flag and writes
`audit.retention_deletion.executed` evidence with counts and hashes rather than
raw payloads. `POST /demo/manufacturing/audit/legal-holds`,
`GET /demo/manufacturing/audit/legal-holds` and
`POST /demo/manufacturing/audit/legal-holds/{hold_id}/release` provide the
audit-backed legal hold activation/list/release workflow used by retention
deletion. Tenant-scoped query permissions remain Platform work.

The replay/simulation foundation consumes API replay artifacts from workflow
run history, timeline events and redacted audit evidence. The `/simulation`
page shows baseline versus simulated policy decisions and
governed connector policy-set version diffs over historical events for the
manufacturing demo. Replay outputs can now be persisted as governed audit
artifacts with `simulation.replay_output.persisted` evidence, retention
metadata and idempotency protection. Replay responses now enforce
retention-aware query windows across timeline, audit and persisted output
records, with a legal-hold bypass for governance review. The browser no longer
constructs replay artifacts from local workflow or audit defaults. Temporal
deterministic replay, arbitrary policy diffing, replay-output deletion jobs and
legal hold workflows for non-audit artifacts remain Platform and Enterprise
work.

The connector foundation exposes a public-safe manifest registry, a
preview-only file/CSV connector for manufacturing asset intake and a
metadata-only external database preview connector. The API can validate CSV
rows, map them to ontology entity proposals and return a redacted audit event
preview through `/demo/manufacturing/connectors/file-csv/preview`. The registry
returned by `/demo/manufacturing/connectors` now reads from the tenant-scoped
`demo_reference_records` bootstrap row instead of a route-owned runtime seed.
The API module no longer defines a connector registry factory; tests validate
the Alembic bootstrap payload directly against the registry schema.
Connector configuration creation resolves connector manifests and runtime
boundaries from that persisted registry reference, then requires a matching
tenant-scoped persisted manifest in `active_preview` before storing tenant
configuration state.
Credential handle creation uses the same persisted registry reference to
validate connector manifests, then requires a matching tenant-scoped persisted
manifest in `active_preview` before storing external secret reference metadata.
Credential lease requests use the same persisted registry reference, then
require a matching tenant-scoped persisted manifest in `active_preview` before
writing lease/audit evidence or calling the lease runtime adapter.
Ontology proposal creation also resolves connector runtime boundary metadata
from that persisted registry reference, then requires a matching tenant-scoped
persisted manifest in `active_preview` before writing proposal/audit state.
Connector run creation uses the same persisted registry reference, then requires
a matching tenant-scoped persisted manifest in `active_preview` before writing
run/audit runtime boundary metadata.
Manual import request creation also uses the same persisted registry reference,
then requires a matching tenant-scoped persisted manifest in `active_preview`
before writing approval-gated import audit evidence.
Ontology promotion execution also uses that persisted registry reference, then
requires a matching tenant-scoped persisted manifest in `active_preview` before
calling the ontology mutation adapter or writing promotion/audit evidence.
Promotion policy authoring, enablement and revision also use that persisted
registry reference before writing policy/audit evidence.
Promotion policy set activation, replacement and rollback also use it before
writing policy-set/audit evidence.
It can also preview declared external DB table metadata through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/external-db/preview`, using profile ids and
credential handles while blocking raw connection material, SQL text and live
queries. Tenant-scoped connector manifests can now be registered through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/manifests`, writing
`connector.manifest.registered` audit evidence while rejecting raw connection
fields, SQL/query text and credential material. The API also stores and
queries tenant-scoped preview connector configuration through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/configurations`, requiring an `active_preview`
manifest and rejecting raw credential fields in configuration payloads. The API
now also stores metadata-only credential handles and rotation history through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/credential-handles`, using external secret
references instead of raw credential values, requiring a matching
tenant-scoped connector manifest in `active_preview` and failing explicitly if
the persisted connector registry reference is missing or invalid. Short-lived
credential leases can now be requested, renewed and revoked through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/credential-leases`, writing
`connector.credential_lease.*` audit evidence while returning only references,
timestamps, permission decisions and adapter evidence. Lease requests require a
matching tenant-scoped connector manifest in `active_preview` before runtime or
audit evidence is written. The lease runtime is deferred by default and can use
the optional self-hosted Vault/KMS adapter when
`AXIS_CREDENTIAL_LEASE_EXECUTION_ENABLED=true`, still without returning secret
material. Provider-specific Vault/KMS adapter profiles can be enabled with
`AXIS_CREDENTIAL_LEASE_PROVIDER_ADAPTERS_ENABLED=true`; the runtime validates
the declared provider mode against the credential handle secret provider,
secret reference prefix and KMS policy metadata for HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets
Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, KMS and local env refs, while
still returning only lease evidence. Connector run records can now be written through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/runs`; each record stores only redacted
summaries and links to an append-only
`connector.run.recorded` audit event. Governed dry-run connector execution now
calls the deferred Axis
connector execution adapter, requires credential handle ids, writes
`connector.run.execution_deferred` audit evidence and still does not start live
sync. Scheduled sync plans can now be recorded through the same run endpoint
with `execution_mode=scheduled_sync_plan`, active credential lease evidence,
schedule metadata and `connector.run.sync_scheduled` audit evidence, while the
deferred scheduler adapter keeps `external_sync_started=false`.
Scheduled plans can now be dispatch-claimed through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/runs/{run_id}/dispatch`, requiring
`connectors:sync:dispatch`, active lease evidence and an idempotency key. The
dispatch boundary writes `connector.run.sync_dispatch_deferred` and still keeps
`external_sync_started=false`.
Dispatch-claimed plans can now receive a sync execution attempt through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/runs/{run_id}/execute-sync`, requiring
`connectors:sync:execute`, active lease evidence and an idempotency key. The
default execution runtime writes `connector.run.sync_execution_deferred`; the
opt-in self-hosted demo runtime, enabled with
`AXIS_CONNECTOR_SYNC_EXECUTION_ENABLED=true`, can write
`connector.run.sync_execution_completed` without external egress, credential
material retrieval or graph mutation.
External DB sync can opt into the Postgres profile adapter boundary with
`AXIS_EXTERNAL_DB_SYNC_EXECUTION_ENABLED=true`, adding public-safe
provider/profile/table/count evidence while still omitting raw connection
strings and credential material.
When an external DB run explicitly requests live query handling, Axis first
records a separate preflight result. The default decision is
`connector.run.sync_execution_preflight_blocked`; setting
`AXIS_EXTERNAL_DB_LIVE_QUERY_PREFLIGHT_ENABLED=true` can produce
`connector.run.sync_execution_preflight_passed` only when the run carries an
approved private endpoint egress boundary, egress policy id, lease-scoped
secret reference and a targeted active checkpoint claim owned by the executing
worker. A further opt-in,
`AXIS_EXTERNAL_DB_LIVE_QUERY_EXECUTION_ENABLED=true`, can execute a bounded
read-only Postgres query only when the manifest is `active_live`, the request
sets `live_query_execute=true`, the configured profile id/schema/table matches
the run, selected columns are omitted or allowlisted, the private endpoint
reference and endpoint-target SHA-256 bind the secret DSN to the persisted
egress policy, and all preflight gates pass. The live-read result persists row
counts, profile id, row limit, query status and checkpoint evidence only; it
does not persist DSNs, SQL text, row payloads, credential material or graph
mutations. Missing `checkpoint_claim_id` or inactive target claims are rejected
before the provider-specific runtime is called, before preflight or live-read
audit is written and before a new execution checkpoint is created. Passed and
blocked preflights with a valid target claim include public-safe checkpoint
claim evidence in the sync result summary. When `live_query_requested=true`,
`execute-sync` must provide `checkpoint_claim_id`; Axis rejects the request
unless that exact claim is active, unexpired, owned by `executed_by` and
backed by `connector.run.sync_checkpoint_claimed` audit evidence whose audit id
resolves in the tenant-scoped append-only audit ledger with matching
connector/run/checkpoint/claim/worker binding and worker-lease-only payload before being
attached to an eligible `sync_execution_preflight_passed` checkpoint for the
same connector and run with `connector.run.sync_execution_preflight_passed`
audit evidence referenced by `evidence_refs`. The referenced audit id must
resolve to a persisted tenant-scoped audit ledger event with the same
connector/run/checkpoint binding, its payload must remain public-safe and the target
checkpoint result evidence must remain public-safe. The target claim result
must remain worker-lease-only with `external_sync_started=false`,
`secret_material_returned=false` and `worker_claim_only=true`. That target
preflight checkpoint still keeps `external_query_started=false`, returns no
credential material and performs no graph mutation. The passed preflight now
depends on validated egress policy
evidence from persisted tenant-scoped policy records and the validated
credential lease result: the runtime records policy
runtime/ref/scope/private-endpoint evidence, blocks unknown or unpersisted
policies before secret retrieval is considered, records lease
id/mode/runtime/result status/reference evidence, records reference-only secret
resolver evidence and blocks the path if the lease reference is missing or if
the lease evidence says secret material was returned. Network policy
preflight and completed/deferred sync execution attempts now also write
tenant-scoped `connector_sync_checkpoints` rows with public-safe cursor and
result evidence for future retry/checkpoint-aware provider adapters. The
checkpoint registry is queryable at
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/runs/checkpoints` with tenant, connector, run,
status, `created_after`, `created_before` and limit filters, and requires the
`connectors:sync:checkpoint:read` scope. Invalid windows where `created_after`
is equal to or later than `created_before` are rejected before checkpoint
storage is queried. Valid checkpoint reads write
`connector.run.sync_checkpoints_read` audit evidence with filters, count,
evidence invariant count and checkpoint ids only. The registry response reports
public-safe evidence invariants for missing, unresolved, mismatched or unsafe
checkpoint audit evidence without copying cursor or result summaries into the
read-audit payload.
Worker claim records are persisted at
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/runs/checkpoints/{checkpoint_id}/claims` with
the `connectors:sync:checkpoint:claim` scope, lease duration metadata,
idempotency-key replay and `connector.run.sync_checkpoint_claimed` audit
evidence. A claim is a worker lease only: it does not start external sync,
retrieve secret material or execute provider-specific connector code. A second
unexpired active claim for the same checkpoint is rejected with 409 before a
duplicate claim/audit record is written. Expired claims are marked `expired`
with `connector.run.sync_checkpoint_claim_expired` before replacement ownership
is created. Claim records are queryable at
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/runs/checkpoints/claims` with tenant, connector,
run, checkpoint, worker, status, `created_after`, `created_before`, cursor and
limit filters. Invalid time windows are rejected before storage reads. Reads
return `has_more` and `next_cursor` for stable cursor-based pagination. Reads require
`connectors:sync:checkpoint:claim:read` and append
`connector.run.sync_checkpoint_claims_read` audit evidence with filters,
pagination metadata, returned claim count and claim ids only. Claim renewal and
release update the same persisted lease record through dedicated scopes, writing
`connector.run.sync_checkpoint_claim_renewed` and
`connector.run.sync_checkpoint_claim_released` audit evidence without
provider-specific connector execution.
enforcement, real secret retrieval and real query execution stay outside this
slice.
The `/connectors` console now fetches connector, credential, egress policy,
run, sync checkpoint, checkpoint claim, evidence invariant, evidence snapshot,
proposal, import and promotion records from the Axis API. Checkpoint rows are
requested with the checkpoint read scope and shown per selected connector with
sequence, adapter, cursor summary, result evidence and audit refs. Checkpoint
claim rows are requested with
`connectors:sync:checkpoint:claim:read` and shown next to the selected
connector checkpoints with worker ownership, lease, renewal/release, invariant
status and secret-material evidence. Evidence snapshot history is requested
with `connectors:evidence:snapshot:read` and shown with newest snapshot id,
invariant totals, evidence surface count and digest prefixes. The console can
create a selected-connector evidence snapshot through
`POST /demo/manufacturing/connectors/evidence-invariants/snapshots` with
`connectors:evidence:snapshot`, generated snapshot/idempotency ids and a
public-safe review reason, then refreshes API-backed history. Snapshot artifacts
with audit event ids link to `/audit?event_id=...`, where the audit explorer
selects the matching persisted event after loading API-backed ledger records.
Persisted snapshot audit events expose only redacted `snapshot_id`,
`connector_id` and idempotency preview fields, and the audit explorer links
back to `/connectors?snapshot_id=...&connector_id=...` so reviewers can reopen
the selected API-backed snapshot artifact. The connector console also loads the
API-backed snapshot export bundle, showing export id, record count, checksum
prefix, redaction policy, integrity algorithm and ledger signature status.
`GET /demo/manufacturing/connectors/evidence-invariants/snapshots/export`
uses `connectors:evidence:snapshot:read`, supports the same snapshot filters
plus an export reason, returns public-safe snapshot metadata with a manifest
checksum and SHA-256 hash-chain proof, and uses the self-hosted audit ledger
signer when configured. `POST
/demo/manufacturing/connectors/evidence-invariants/snapshots/export-requests`
records an approval-required export request with workflow id, idempotency key,
snapshot filter, requested snapshot count, checksum preview and storage status
`not_written`; it creates approval/audit evidence and waits for explicit
materialization before writing any storage artifact. `POST
/demo/manufacturing/connectors/evidence-invariants/snapshots/export-requests/{export_request_id}/decision`
records the approval decision, updates the export request to
`approval_approved` or `approval_rejected`, signals the workflow runtime through
the Axis adapter and keeps storage status `not_written` until the approved
request is explicitly materialized. `POST
/demo/manufacturing/connectors/evidence-invariants/snapshots/export-requests/{export_request_id}/materializations`
requires `connectors:evidence:snapshot:export:materialize`, verifies that the
request was approved and the snapshot checksum still matches, writes the
public-safe export bundle to the configured object-store adapter, records
checksum/size/storage URI metadata and appends audit evidence. Local demos use
the filesystem adapter; S3-compatible profiles can write retained objects when
the WORM readiness gate is configured. If the backend is unavailable the
console shows an
API-required empty state instead of rendering local connector fallback records.
Preview-derived ontology proposals can now be persisted through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/ontology-proposals`; each proposal is
audit-backed, initially marked with `graph_mutation_status=not_applied` and
fails explicitly when the persisted connector registry reference is missing or
invalid.
Manual connector import requests can now be recorded through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/manual-imports`; each request is tenant-scoped,
idempotent, approval-gated, workflow-referenced and audit-backed with
`connector.manual_import.requested`, while graph mutation remains
`not_applied`. Creation resolves connector runtime boundary metadata from the
persisted connector registry reference and fails explicitly if that reference
is missing or invalid before writing rows or audit events. Decisions can now be
recorded through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/manual-imports/{import_id}/decision`; each
decision stores the approval outcome, workflow signal status and
`connector.manual_import.decision_recorded` audit evidence without executing
the connector. Approved proposal promotion can now be requested through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/ontology-proposals/promotions`; each promotion
requires approval evidence, workflow signal evidence, idempotency,
`connectors:ontology:promote` and a tenant-scoped connector manifest in
`active_preview`, then applies or defers the TypeDB graph mutation through the
Axis ontology mutation adapter with append-only
`connector.ontology_promotion.*` audit evidence. Replays with the same
idempotency key and payload return the existing request or promotion instead of
writing duplicate audit events. Connector promotion policies can now be
authored through `/demo/manufacturing/connectors/promotion-policies`; each
policy records the authoring permission, required promotion scopes, approved
manual import state, workflow signal state, allowed risk levels and
`connector.promotion_policy.authored` audit evidence without executing
connectors or mutating TypeDB. Authoring validates connector ids through the
persisted registry reference and fails explicitly if that reference is missing
or invalid before writing rows or audit events. Policies are enabled through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/promotion-policies/{policy_id}/enable`, which
requires `connectors:promotion_policy:enable`, an approved decision, workflow
signal evidence and writes `connector.promotion_policy.enabled`; enablement
revalidates the policy connector through the persisted registry reference
before updating state. Draft policies can be revised append-only through
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/promotion-policies/{policy_id}/revise`, which
requires `connectors:promotion_policy:revise`, approved revision evidence,
workflow signal evidence and an idempotency key. Revisions validate the
requested connector through the persisted registry reference before writing the
new draft or audit evidence. Enabled required policies are not revised in
place; future versions must be adopted through a governed policy-set
transition. Enabled required policies are auto-selected when a
promotion request omits `policy_id` and are enforced before the TypeDB mutation
adapter is called. When more than one enabled required policy applies,
`/demo/manufacturing/connectors/promotion-policy-sets`
can activate a versioned active set with
`connectors:promotion_policy_set:activate`; activation validates the connector
through the persisted registry reference before writing set/audit evidence. The
promotion endpoint evaluates all policies in that set and stores
`policy_set_id`, `policy_ids` and
`policy_set_enforced` evidence. When a policy set is active, explicit single
`policy_id` selection is rejected so promotions cannot bypass the full
required-gate set. Replacing or rolling back an active set requires
`replaces_policy_set_id`, an approved transition decision and workflow evidence.
Replacement writes `connector.promotion_policy_set.replaced`; rollback restores a
superseded target through a new active version, writes
`connector.promotion_policy_set.rolled_back` and marks the previous active set
`superseded`. Replacement can carry `policy_revision_adoptions` so approved
draft revisions are adopted atomically with the set transition; Axis writes
`connector.promotion_policy.revision_adopted`, supersedes the current required
policy and stores adoption evidence on the new active set. Policy and
policy-set promotion rejections write
`connector.ontology_promotion.rejected` audit evidence with the effective
policy context before the API returns 422. If multiple required policies exist
without an active set, Axis still rejects implicit selection.
The file/CSV and external DB preview endpoints now resolve connector ids,
schema fields, runtime row limits and public-safe sample rows through the same
persisted connector registry reference before returning preview output. Missing
or invalid registry references return explicit 404/422 responses before any
preview mapping is generated.
The `/connectors` console shows runtime boundaries, required permissions,
blocked operations, tenant configuration, credential handle posture, connector
run evidence from persisted registry-backed run creation, deferred execution metadata,
persisted ontology proposal
evidence, promotion evidence, manual import decision evidence, promotion policy
authoring/enforcement evidence, versioned policy-set evidence, aggregate
evidence invariant posture, evidence snapshot history and schema mapping from
API-backed records only.
It can author promotion policies through the API when available, enable them
with approval/workflow evidence and reports API persistence errors without
recording local public-safe previews when the API is offline. The browser
runtime no longer exports connector registry, preview, credential, run,
proposal, import, promotion policy or policy-set default records; connector
unit tests use local fixtures instead of product runtime fallbacks.
Live connector manifests can now move from `active_preview` to `active_live`
only when both lifecycle and live-enable scopes, live-capable runtime policy,
live sync mode and approval/policy/credential evidence are present. The
transition writes append-only audit evidence and still does not retrieve
secrets, execute connector code, start external sync or mutate the ontology
graph. Live provider secret retrieval, provider-specific scheduled live sync
beyond the self-hosted execution boundary, live external database adapters and
connector-backed production actions remain Platform work.

The agent registry is currently read-only and API required. The browser no
longer carries local agent fallback records, and the API module no longer
defines an agent registry runtime seed factory. Production action execution,
persisted agent state, tenant-scoped agent configuration, runtime policy
enforcement and model cost observability remain Platform work.

The action registry UI is API required for catalog browsing. The browser no
longer carries local action fallback records, and the API module no longer
defines an action registry runtime seed factory. Typed dry-run/proposal action
requests can now be persisted through the demo API with idempotency enforcement
and append-only audit events. Approval-gated action payloads now signal the Axis
workflow runtime adapter after persistence, with explicit degraded status when
the runtime is unavailable. When a bearer token is present, or when OIDC auth is
required by configuration, action run creation derives tenant, actor and scopes
from token claims and rejects actor impersonation before persistence. Action
payload fields marked as ontology references also require the scopes attached to
their connected ontology relationships from the persisted ontology reference
record, preventing cross-domain resource references from bypassing the typed
action permission check. Live production execution, connector invocation and
broader relationship-aware permission enforcement remain Platform work.

Approval decisions now also reconcile persisted workflow state when the linked
`workflow_runs` row exists: the pending signal records the decision, the run
state/status/current step are updated and a workflow timeline event is appended.
This keeps the persisted workflow console coherent without requiring a live
Temporal worker.

The model routing and cost observability layer is currently read-only and API
required. The browser no longer carries local route telemetry fallback records,
and the API reference now comes from a persisted tenant-scoped bootstrap row.
The API module no longer defines a route telemetry seed factory.
Live provider adapters, provider-specific billing ingestion, tenant budget
enforcement, persisted usage records, OpenTelemetry spans from runtime code and
audit writes from live route decisions remain Platform work.

  model validation.
- [x] Add support and operations runbook baseline.
- [x] Add production support-readiness contract for support model, escalation
  channel classes, SLO targets and customer-facing runbook/status-page
  configuration.

  support commitments, named staffing model, customer-specific incident
  operations and legal SLA terms.

## Expansion Rule

Axis starts unified, but the architecture must keep boundaries extractable.

Future repositories may include:

- `limes-axis-cloud`
- `limes-axis-enterprise`
- `limes-axis-connectors`
- `limes-axis-sdk`
- `limes-axis-deploy`
- `limes-axis-docs`

Extraction should happen when a module has at least two of these traits:

- independent release cadence;
- separate team or ownership;
- enterprise-only secrets, permissions or deployment logic;
- customer-specific integrations;
- independent SDK versioning;
- large connector surface;
- cloud operations that differ materially from the open-source core;
- documentation needs that outgrow the product repo.

## Contribution Policy

The project uses Apache-2.0 for the open-source core and plans to require a
Contributor License Agreement before accepting substantial external
contributions.

The CLA text in this repository is an initial project baseline and should be
reviewed legally before broad external contribution intake.

## What Is Intentionally Not Promised Yet

- No production readiness claim.
- No completed ERP/MES/CRM integrations.
- No uncontrolled autonomous agents.
- No dependency on a proprietary hosted model provider.
- No promise that commercial Cloud or Enterprise code will live in this repo.
