# Support Operations Runbook

This runbook defines the current public-safe support and operations baseline for
Limes Axis demo, design-partner evaluation and production-readiness review
environments. It is not a signed customer support contract, SLA, SOC process or
compliance attestation.

## Scope

In scope:

- Local Docker Compose demo support.
- SME feedback and enterprise evaluation walkthrough support.
- Public-safe diagnostic capture through `/support/diagnostics`.
- Readiness posture review through `/ready`, `/identity/oidc/readiness`,
  `/deployment/readiness`, `make demo-check-live` and `make security-check`.
- Production support-readiness review through a configured support model,
  severity response targets, escalation channel classes and customer runbook
  presence checks.
- Triage of API, web console, persistence, workflow and connector-boundary
  issues in the open-source repository.

Out of scope:

- Customer incident response ownership.
- Signed SLAs, RPO/RTO commitments, warranty terms or customer-specific legal
  commitments.
- Managed Cloud, Enterprise private deployment support and customer-specific
  connector execution.
- Handling customer credentials, production datasets or private infrastructure
  access in the public repository.

## Public-Safe Diagnostic Bundle

Before a support or design-partner session, capture:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/support/diagnostics | python3 -m json.tool
make demo-check
make security-check
make demo-check-live
```

The support diagnostics endpoint is designed to be safe to share in public
issues or design-partner notes. It reports:

- service and environment profile;
- demo-support and production-support readiness booleans;
- deployment posture summary;
- identity readiness summary;
- model egress, connector execution, audit signing and object-store posture;
- support model readiness, severity response targets and escalation channel
  classes;
- support blockers;
- links to the relevant runbooks and threat model.

It must not return bearer tokens, raw JWKS, credential material, signing
material, database DSNs, customer runbook URLs, status page URLs or personal
contact details.

## Production Support Readiness Contract

`/support/diagnostics` reports `production_support_ready=true` only when the
deployment is production-ready and the public-safe support model is configured.
The support model is intentionally operational rather than contractual: it
proves that the environment has support controls wired, but it does not create
a signed SLA.

Required configuration:

- `AXIS_SUPPORT_MODEL_ENABLED=true`
- `AXIS_SUPPORT_COVERAGE=24x7`
- positive response targets for `AXIS_SUPPORT_S1_RESPONSE_MINUTES`,
  `AXIS_SUPPORT_S2_RESPONSE_MINUTES`, `AXIS_SUPPORT_S3_RESPONSE_MINUTES` and
  `AXIS_SUPPORT_S4_RESPONSE_MINUTES`, ordered from shortest to longest;
- at least two non-personal escalation channel classes in
  `AXIS_SUPPORT_ESCALATION_CHANNELS`, for example
  `["customer_success_manager","platform_engineering_on_call"]`;
- HTTPS `AXIS_SUPPORT_CUSTOMER_RUNBOOK_URL`;
- HTTPS `AXIS_SUPPORT_STATUS_PAGE_URL`;
- `AXIS_SUPPORT_INCIDENT_REVIEW_REQUIRED=true`.

The diagnostics response returns only booleans for customer runbook and status
page configuration. It does not echo the configured URLs. Escalation channel
values must be role or function labels, not personal names, phone numbers,
emails or private chat handles.

## Triage Flow

1. Confirm the environment profile from `/support/diagnostics`.
2. Confirm `/health` and `/ready` return HTTP 200.
3. Run `make demo-check` to validate static repository expectations.
4. Run `make security-check` to validate threat-model and posture contracts.
5. Run `make demo-check-live` while API and web are running.
6. If the issue is browser-visible, run `pnpm --filter @limes-axis/web test:e2e`
   and capture the failing route or console surface.
7. If the issue involves live services, run `make test-integration` with Docker
   services up.
8. Record the failing check name, route, command and timestamp in the issue or
   customer note.

## Severity Guidance

| Severity | Example | Response Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | Data exposure, cross-tenant access, audit evidence tampering | Stop demo/customer use, preserve evidence, open security review immediately |
| S2 | API unavailable, migration failure, broken demo readiness gate | Restore demo path or document blocker before the next walkthrough |
| S3 | Single console page degraded while API evidence is healthy | Triage with route-specific tests and browser evidence |
| S4 | Documentation mismatch, wording issue, missing checklist item | Fix through normal PR review |

## Evidence To Preserve

- Command output from the failed check.
- API route and HTTP status.
- Browser route and screenshot when UI is involved.
- Current git SHA.
- Docker Compose service status.
- Whether the issue appears in local demo, production-like evaluation or both.
- Any relevant audit event id, workflow run id or connector run id.

Do not paste customer credentials, raw tokens, private JWKS, database DSNs,
connector secrets or private production records into public issues.

## Escalation Boundaries

Escalate immediately when:

- `/support/diagnostics` reports unexpected production support readiness.
- `/deployment/readiness` omits known production blockers.
- `make security-check` fails.
- A tenant mismatch, actor impersonation or permission bypass is suspected.
- Audit integrity, legal hold or retention controls appear inconsistent.
- Connector credential handles, leases or external egress controls expose
  sensitive material.

## Current Production Gaps

- The production support-readiness contract, escalation channel classes and SLO
  target checks are implemented, but signed customer SLAs, named on-call
  staffing, legal terms and customer-specific incident operations remain
  commercial/enterprise work.
- Production backup, restore, retention, HA and disaster recovery are not
  complete across every stateful dependency.
- Enterprise SSO now has readiness/profile reporting and a PKCE
  authorization-code session-cookie API boundary with server-side local and
  federated logout revocation, but refresh-token rotation, IdP onboarding and
  production SSO operations are not complete.
- S3/MinIO WORM adapter readiness and a bounded object-store recovery
  rehearsal are implemented, but production bucket provisioning review, KMS
  policy, legal operations and full-bucket restore drills remain Enterprise
  work.
- A bounded Temporal namespace/history evidence rehearsal is implemented, but
  Temporal persistence restore, deterministic replay operations, archival
  policy review and RPO/RTO evidence remain Enterprise work.
- A bounded Secret rotation rehearsal is implemented, but upstream
  secret-manager rotation, access reviews, workload restart validation,
  rollback criteria and incident procedures remain Enterprise work.
- Live customer connector execution remains gated and should not be enabled
  without provider policy bundles, audit evidence and customer approval.
