# Platform Overview

The first Platform slice turns the governance console overview into an
API-backed operational demo surface.

## Demo Scope

The manufacturing overview reference is API-owned, public-safe and persisted as
a tenant-scoped bootstrap record. It uses roles, system IDs and demo tenant IDs
rather than personal names or customer data. The browser does not carry local
overview records, and the API no longer defines the overview as a runtime seed
function.

It models the first Plant Operations Cockpit scenario:

- workflow load;
- pending approvals;
- governed agents;
- audit evidence;
- supplier, quality and maintenance risk signals.

## API Contract

The FastAPI service exposes:

```text
GET /demo/manufacturing/overview
```

The endpoint reads the active `demo_reference_records` row for
`tenant_demo_manufacturing`, `surface=overview` and
`reference_id=manufacturing-overview`, then returns a typed overview for the
demo tenant:

- summary metrics;
- risk signals;
- active workflow summaries;
- approval queue summaries;
- governed agent summaries;
- recent audit evidence.

The schema is included in `docs/openapi.json` and checked by CI through
`make openapi-check`. The endpoint returns 404 when the persisted reference
record is missing and 422 when the persisted payload fails the overview
contract.

## Persistence Boundary

Alembic migration `0022_demo_reference_records` creates the
`demo_reference_records` table and inserts the public-safe manufacturing
overview bootstrap record. The table is tenant-scoped, keyed by surface and
reference id, and designed for future extraction of demo/reference content out
of runtime code without moving browser fallback data back into the console.

## Console Behavior

The Next.js overview page loads the demo endpoint from
`NEXT_PUBLIC_AXIS_API_BASE_URL`. If the API is unavailable, the console shows an
API-required state and does not render local overview records.

The overview also uses the public Axis console shell: dark Axis Black and
Graphite surfaces, Signal Blue state emphasis, Teal Pulse success emphasis and
compact operational cards. The visual layer is tested separately from the data
contract so that brand changes do not reintroduce browser-local records.

The overview also composes:

```text
GET /demo/manufacturing/demo-readiness
```

The readiness report is computed from the persisted manufacturing operations
snapshot. It exposes SME feedback and enterprise evaluation tracks, evidence
checks, explicit production-readiness limitations and next actions. It does not
generate artifacts, query source systems, run connectors or rely on
browser-local mock data.

The console shell notification panel also uses:

```text
GET /demo/manufacturing/notifications
```

The endpoint derives a notification read model from the persisted operations
snapshot rather than from browser-local state. It surfaces operation-domain
attention, pending approvals, blocked workflow signals and recent audit
evidence with stable notification ids, routes and evidence references. It does
not create user notification rows, mark notifications read or acknowledge
events; authenticated read/ack state remains future Platform work.

This is an API reference path, not a production data loading path. Future
Platform work will replace remaining bootstrap records with tenant-scoped,
authenticated API surfaces backed by Postgres, TypeDB and workflow state.

## Verification

Covered by:

- API unit tests for the manufacturing overview reference endpoint;
- repository tests for tenant-scoped demo reference records;
- migration payload validation against the `ManufacturingOverview` contract;
- generated OpenAPI drift check;
- web unit tests for the API response contract;
- web unit tests for the Axis brand tokens;
- Playwright smoke tests for API-required overview behavior, Axis shell tokens
  and no horizontal overflow on desktop and mobile.
- API and Playwright coverage for the API-backed notification panel and its
  no-fallback behavior.
