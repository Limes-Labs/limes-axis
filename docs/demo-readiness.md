# Demo Readiness

This page defines the repeatable local demo contract for Limes Axis. It is
written for real SME and enterprise feedback sessions: the environment must use
the Axis API, migrations, persisted bootstrap records and local self-hosted
services, not browser-local mock data.

## Current Position

Axis is ready for a structured SME feedback demo when the acceptance checklist
below passes on the demo machine.

Axis is ready for an enterprise evaluation demo as an architecture and product
workflow walkthrough when the same checklist passes and the limitations section
is shared before the session. It is not yet a production enterprise deployment:
the first Helm baseline exists, but production disaster recovery, SSO
hardening, customer bucket operations, secret-manager rotation operations, high
availability and signed production operations commitments remain tracked
Enterprise work.

## No Browser-Local Mock Data

The governance console is API-required. Demo records shown in the browser must
come from Axis API responses backed by persisted tenant-scoped bootstrap rows,
Postgres operational state, generated audit artifacts or explicit deferred
runtime evidence.

The demo may include deterministic reference records because those records are
part of the migrated demo tenant state. It must not rely on hidden browser
fallback data, local random factories or UI-only mock objects.

## Local Runtime

The local demo stack is self-hosted through Docker Compose:

- Postgres for operational state and migrations.
- TypeDB for the ontology boundary.
- Temporal for workflow runtime integration.
- MinIO for the S3-compatible object-store path.
- Keycloak for self-hosted OIDC evaluation.

Start the service stack:

```bash
make demo-stack-up
```

Apply database migrations:

```bash
make demo-db-upgrade
```

Run the API:

```bash
make demo-api
```

Run the governance console in a second terminal:

```bash
make demo-web
```

The local console is configured for both `localhost:3000` and
`127.0.0.1:3000` development access, and the API also allows the
`localhost:3100` and `127.0.0.1:3100` origins used by Playwright against the
production Next.js build. This keeps the in-app Browser, local review sessions
and automated browser checks on the same Axis API.

Run static demo checks:

```bash
make demo-check
```

Run the security posture and threat model contract:

```bash
make security-check
```

Run the Kubernetes/Helm deployment package contract:

```bash
make deployment-check
make deployment-backup-rehearsal-plan
make deployment-restore-rehearsal-plan
make deployment-typedb-recovery-rehearsal-plan
make deployment-object-storage-recovery-rehearsal-plan
make deployment-temporal-recovery-rehearsal-plan
make deployment-secret-rotation-rehearsal-plan
make deployment-ha-rehearsal-plan
make deployment-load-rehearsal-plan
make deployment-tls-readiness-plan
```

Run the API/web container image contract:

```bash
make container-check
```

Plan, capture or restore repeatable local demo state with the
[`backup and restore runbook`](./backup-restore.md):

```bash
make demo-backup-plan
make demo-backup-local
AXIS_BACKUP_DIR=.axis/backups/<backup-id> make demo-restore-local
```

Run static and live checks after the API and web console are running:

```bash
make demo-check-live
```

The live check includes the OIDC readiness contract at
`/identity/oidc/readiness` and the IdP onboarding report at
`/identity/oidc/onboarding`. The reports are public-safe: they show whether
bearer tokens are required, whether the issuer is HTTPS, whether JWKS is
explicitly configured, whether asymmetric algorithms are used, which
actor/tenant claims are bound, whether the authorization-code session-cookie
settings are hardened, whether the federated end-session redirect is configured
and which exact redirect/logout URIs an identity administrator must allow. They
do not expose tokens, secrets, passwords or raw JWKS material. A
local default profile can pass the demo contract while still showing
`enterprise_sso_ready=false`; enterprise evaluation sessions should share that
status honestly.

The live check also includes `/deployment/readiness`, which aggregates identity,
OIDC secure-cookie/session posture, external model egress, live connector
execution, audit signing, object-store posture, network egress restrictions and
public-safe disaster-recovery procedure readiness into explicit production
blockers. The current local profile can be demo-safe while
`production_ready=false`; that is intentional until enterprise deployment,
S3/MinIO object-store posture, restricted/offline egress, DR procedures and
signed support commitments are complete.

The live check also includes `/support/diagnostics`, a public-safe support
bundle for design-partner triage. It reports demo-support readiness,
production-support blockers, support model readiness, SLO target configuration,
support commitment readiness, support artifact links and redaction policy
without returning bearer tokens, raw JWKS, credential material, signing
material, database DSNs, customer runbook URLs, status page URLs, contract text,
staffing details or personal contact details.

Run browser smoke tests against the production Next.js build:

```bash
pnpm --filter @limes-axis/web test:e2e
```

Run the live browser smoke test when the local API is running:

```bash
pnpm --filter @limes-axis/web test:e2e:live
```

Stop the stack:

```bash
make demo-stack-down
```

## SME Feedback Demo

The SME demo should focus on operational governance:

- How Axis sits above ERP, MES, QMS, CMMS and supplier systems.
- How the ontology turns operational records into governed relationships.
- How approvals, actions, workflows, audit and agent boundaries are connected.
- How sensitive connector operations are staged through manifests, credential
  handles, leases, egress policies and evidence snapshots.
- How a plant manager or operations leader can review risk, action proposals
  and evidence without trusting an ungoverned agent.

Feedback to collect:

- Which operational systems must be connected first.
- Which approval gates map to existing SOPs.
- Which fields must be added to the manufacturing operations reference.
- Which audit exports are needed for internal governance or customers.
- Which deployment posture is acceptable: SaaS, managed single tenant,
  private cloud or on-prem.

## Enterprise Evaluation Demo

The enterprise evaluation demo should be framed as a product and architecture
walkthrough, not a production readiness claim.

Show:

- The self-hosted local stack and absence of required managed services.
- The OIDC/Keycloak direction, token-bound mutation paths, authorization-code
  session-cookie boundary, secure browser-session readiness gate and OIDC
  readiness report.
- The support diagnostics bundle and current support operations runbook.
- The first Helm deployment baseline in `infra/helm/limes-axis`, the
  deployment guide and the `deployment-check` output.
- The API and web image baseline, local build commands and the
  `container-check` output.
- The current threat model, including assets, trust boundaries, abuse paths,
  existing controls and open production hardening work.
- Tenant-scoped persisted reference records.
- Append-only audit events, export manifests and signature evidence.
- Deferred runtime boundaries for risky or external operations.
- The expansion path from one public repository into cloud, enterprise, SDK,
  connector, deployment and docs repositories when thresholds are reached.

Confirm before the session:

- No customer secrets are entered.
- No production source systems are connected.
- No unmanaged external model egress is enabled.
- No production deployment or compliance certification is claimed.

## Current Limitations

- Full live connector execution is not yet the default demo path.
- Full manufacturing operations reference demo remains open until broader
  TypeDB query coverage, workflow execution and replay are fully backed by real
  persistence paths.
- The first Helm chart and Kubernetes deployment guide are present, including
  optional External Secrets Operator synchronization, optional TLS Ingress
  routing and optional cert-manager ingress-shim annotations for runtime
  services plus optional HorizontalPodAutoscaler and PodDisruptionBudget
  controls, scheduling/topology pass-through values and configurable rollout
  controls for RollingUpdate strategy, revision history, termination grace and
  lifecycle hooks, a Postgres production backup rehearsal plan, an isolated
  Postgres restore rehearsal plan, a TypeDB recovery rehearsal plan and an
  object storage recovery rehearsal plan, a Temporal recovery evidence
  rehearsal plan, an active/staged Secret rotation rehearsal plan, a HA restart
  rehearsal, a bounded load rehearsal and a TLS readiness rehearsal, but
  sustained customer-profile HA validation under load, automated
  DNS/certificate operations, renewal drills, full cluster
  backup/restore across Temporal persistence, full-bucket object storage
  restore, rollout-drain exercises, full load/capacity planning,
  secret-manager rotation drills and access reviews are not complete.
- Local Docker Compose backup and restore procedures are available for
  repeatable demos; production backup, restore, retention, HA and disaster
  recovery procedures are not complete.
- Enterprise SSO hardening now has an explicit API readiness profile, IdP
  onboarding API report, PKCE authorization-code, HTTP-only session-cookie API
  boundary, secure browser-session deployment gate and server-side local and
  federated logout revocation, but refresh-token rotation and production SSO
  operations runbooks are not complete.
- API rate limiting is available and tracked by deployment readiness, but
  global abuse throttling, alerting and incident response runbooks are not
  complete.
- S3/MinIO WORM adapter readiness and a bounded object storage recovery
  rehearsal exist for governed connector evidence exports, but customer bucket
  provisioning review, KMS policy, legal operations and full-bucket restore
  drills are not complete.
- Production support-readiness checks now include support model, escalation,
  SLO and support commitment gates, but actual signed customer agreements,
  personal staffing assignments and legal documents remain external
  commercial artifacts.
- External model-provider execution is disabled by default.

## Automated Checks

The `services/api/scripts/check_demo_environment.py` script verifies:

- Demo Makefile targets.
- Local demo backup and restore Makefile targets.
- Local Docker Compose runtime services.
- Critical OpenAPI routes.
- Demo readiness documentation and README links.
- Backup and restore runbook commands, artifact names and destructive-restore
  warning language.
- Browser no-store CORS preflight for API-required console fetches across the
  local dev and Playwright production-build origins.
- Manufacturing operations snapshot contract with persisted domain rollups.
- Demo readiness report contract with tracks, checks and an explicit
  `derived_from_persisted_demo_evidence` boundary.
- OIDC readiness report contract with public-safe identity configuration
  status and no secret disclosure.
- Deployment readiness report contract with public-safe production blockers for
  identity, OIDC secure-cookie/session posture, external model egress,
  connector execution, audit signing and object-store posture.
- Deployment package contract for `infra/helm/limes-axis`, public deployment
  docs and externalized Kubernetes Secret usage through `make deployment-check`.
- Deployment rollout rehearsal plan for Helm upgrade, Kubernetes rollout
  status, API `/ready` and rollback mechanics through
  `make deployment-rollout-rehearsal-plan`.
- Helm smoke-test hook for in-cluster API `/ready` and web service checks
  through `helm test`.
- Secret rotation rehearsal plan for active/staged runtime Secret comparison,
  required key parity checks, redacted key-status evidence and SHA-256
  fingerprints without raw secret output through
  `make deployment-secret-rotation-rehearsal-plan`.
- HA restart rehearsal plan for API/web workload restart mechanics,
  Kubernetes availability waits, optional HPA/PDB checks and Helm smoke tests
  through `make deployment-ha-rehearsal-plan`.
- Bounded load rehearsal plan for short-lived Fortio Kubernetes Jobs,
  `kubectl create job`, `kubectl logs` evidence and cleanup through
  `make deployment-load-rehearsal-plan`.
- TLS readiness rehearsal plan for Ingress, cert-manager Certificate, DNS,
  `openssl s_client` and HTTPS reachability checks through
  `make deployment-tls-readiness-plan`.
- Container image package contract for API/web Dockerfiles, local build
  commands and `.dockerignore` through `make container-check`.
- Support diagnostics report contract with public-safe support model readiness,
  SLO targets, escalation channel classes, support commitment booleans, support
  blockers, artifact links and redaction policy.
- Threat model and security posture contract through `make security-check`.
- Optional live API and web checks when URLs are provided.

The check is intentionally conservative. If a demo command, route or document
is removed, the test suite should fail before a feedback session relies on a
broken path.
