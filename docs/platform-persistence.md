# Platform Persistence Foundation

The persistence foundation adds the first Postgres-backed storage boundary for
governed operational state.

It is intentionally narrow: schema, ORM models, repository methods, a demo
approval decision endpoint and tests. It does not yet replace all public demo
seeds or make the web console submit persisted decisions.

## Tables

The second Alembic migration adds:

- `approval_records`: tenant-scoped approval requests, owner role, risk level,
  decision state, decision actor and decision timestamp.
- `action_runs`: tenant-scoped action execution records, idempotency key,
  execution mode, requested actor, optional approval/workflow references and
  result payload.

The existing `audit_events` table remains the append-only event foundation.

## Repository Boundary

`AxisPersistenceRepository` provides:

- append-only audit event insert and tenant-scoped listing;
- approval record creation and decision update;
- approval listing by tenant and optional status;
- action run creation;
- idempotency lookup by tenant, action and key;
- action run result update;
- action run listing by tenant and optional status.

Repository methods flush but do not commit. Callers keep transaction ownership
through `session_scope` or an explicit SQLAlchemy session.

## Current Scope

Delivered:

- Alembic migration `0002_persistence_foundation`;
- SQLAlchemy models for `ApprovalRecord` and `ActionRun`;
- portable unit tests with SQLite in memory;
- Postgres integration check through Alembic head;
- tenant-scoped repository methods;
- idempotency uniqueness for action runs.
- persisted demo approval decisions with `approval.decision.recorded` audit
  events.

Still Platform work:

- web console submission to the persisted decision endpoint;
- workflow signal execution after approved actions;
- production audit writes from action runtime paths;
- immutable storage hardening beyond insert-only repository shape;
- retention/export controls;
- replay and simulation from persisted histories.
